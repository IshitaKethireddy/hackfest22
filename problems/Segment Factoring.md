# Problem
You have an infinitely long digital panel. Using various combinations of 77 segments, we can represent each digit. The picture shows how all 10 decimal digits are displayed.

Initially, all segments in the panel are off. You are given seven integers A, B, C, D, E, F and G representing the number of coins required to turn on the respective segment, as shown above.

Given an integer N, find the minimum number of coins you need to spend to display some factor of N on the panel.

### Input Format
The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The T test cases then follow.
The only line of each test case contains eight space-separated integers N, A, B, C, D, E, F and G, denoting the integer NN and the number of coins required to turn on each of the seven segments.
### Output Format
For each test case, output a single integer - the minimum number of coins you need to spend to display some factor of NN on the panel.
